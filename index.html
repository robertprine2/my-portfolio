				<h3>Module 1: Mastering the Browser</h3>

				<h4> Length: 5 weeks</h4>

				<p><b>Week 1:</b> In the first week, we were introduced to GIT/GitHub, taken through HTML, and learned the basics of CSS. The homework was to create a basic portfolio website that matched pictures given to us changing personal information to showcase ourselves (Grade: ).</p>

				<p><b>Week 2:</b> In the second week, we focused on CSS in depth, including bootstrap and how to make websites responsive. In addition, they taught us how to put our files onto Heroku's servers so that our web pages could be viewed by everyone on the internet. We covered a lot of different ways to manipulate a webpage and were encouraged to dig deeper on our own. The homework was to make our <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/Basic-Portfolio.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Robert's Basic Portfolio">basic portfolio website responsive</a> and to create a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/my-portfolio.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - This Website">unique portfolio website</a> (Grade: A+), using bootstrap or coding on our own, that we could use to highlight our strengths and future projects to prospective employers.</p>

				<p><b>Week 3:</b> In the third week, we learned the basics of Javascript. We covered different variables including arrays and objects. We then used those variables to make functions and methods to produce basic games. The homework was to make a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/Hangman.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Brains: Dead Walking">themed hangman game</a> (Grade: A) using what we have learned so far in Javascript.

				<p><b>Week 4:</b> In the fourth week, we learned more about JavaScript, but focused on jQuery. We also covered some theory with scope and how to arrange variables in your code. There were a lot of games with button components as well as making a calculator in the browser complete with buttons. The homework was to make a game where characters would fight each other when you clicked an attack button. I learned two important lessons from this week's homework. Do not go too deep for a project you only have one week to work on and dynamic programming is much better than copying and pasting code and then having to go back and tweak the code for each different character. I wasn't able to finish <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/rpgGame" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Street Brawl: Legends Rising">my interpretation</a> of the game in time so I had to create the <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/week-4-game.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Star Wars RPG">regular homework</a> (Grade: A+) on the last day.</p>

				<p><b>Week 5:</b> In the fifth week, we learned more about JavaScript and jQuery with a focus on "this" in coding and using time through setInterval and setTimeout. We also reviewed previous content, covered some interview dos and don'ts, and got a chance to meet with Sugarfree Media Group to help give us insight into our future careers. The homework was to make a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/TriviaGame.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Trivia Game">trivia game</a> (Grade: A+).</p>

				<h3>Module 2: API and JSON</h3>

				<h4>Length: 4 weeks</h4>

				<p><b>Week 6:</b> In the sixth week, we learned APIs and how to access JSON data. We used several different APIs to practice making calls into the objects to put data on a web page. Rajiv Menon, the founder of Informulate, talked to us about having a plan going into the field through using Lean Startup and Agile methodologies, continuously learning because the tech world is constantly changing, and integrating yourself within a company through learning different aspects beyond just development. This will help to make you more productive, have more of a big picture feel of the goals of the company, and make you more of an asset to the company as a whole since you are tied to more than just one replaceable niche. The homework was to make a website that used the <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/giphy.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Giphy API">Giphy API</a> (Grade: A).</p>

				<p><b>Week 7:</b> In the seventh week, we learned about local storage, session storage, and cookies. We also covered Firebase to allow us access to servers to store and retrieve data to add persistence to websites and Moment.js to manipulate time. The homework was to make a website that allowed two people on different computers to duke it out in a fast paced game of <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/rps-plain.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - RPS">rock, paper, scissors</a> (Grade: A).</p>

				<p><b>Week 8-9:</b> In the eighth and ninth weeks, we worked in teams to create a web app. I was chosen to be the team lead and it gave me a different look into the world of coding.</p>
				<p>I thought this week was a very good experience overall since this is what coding in most workplaces would be like. As for imporvements, I learned that I should have been more clear with timelines on goals for my team members, we should have split the project up into smaller chunks so that you would get more of a sense of accomplishment when you completed a task (instead of just telling someone to do HTML/CSS, which doesn't give a smooth progression and the details aren't discussed), and that communication is extremely important, so it would have been more helpful to my team if I had done some type of expectations with communication from the beginning. I did learn a lot from my group members about branding, some APIs that I hadn't used before, and we did finish our goal for the basic app (we had much bigger plans for it, but we wouldn't have been able to complete everything within the time allotted). I also got to experience a lot more of Git/GitHub with branches, merging, conflicts, and reverting to old code (a lot), so I feel more well rounded with it now.</p>
				<p>The homework was to make a web app that was persistent, used at least two APIs, and had a lot of other minor requirements as well. Our team created an app called <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/EventSpot-" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Event Spot">Event Spot</a> that allows users to plan all the different aspects of events, parties, gatherings, etc. in one spot. We used firebase to store users, who logged in through their google accounts, and the Foursquare, Google Maps, and eBay APIs to allow users to find venues, buy decorations, and buy outfits for their event. If we had more time we would have built in a catering section, added more options for decorations and outfits through other APIs, added a messaging function to discuss the progress of the event, create a total purchase amount to show what the total cost would be of all items currently listed in Event Spot, add a way to switch between multiple events so that you wouldn't only have one area to work on, and buttons to allow for sharing the event, when completed, to various social media websites.</p>
				<p>After we created our app, we had to pitch it to our classmates and share its functionality. This was another great experience since pitching ideas to buyers or my employer is going to be something I see myself doing in the future. Overall, I was pleased with what we accomplished in the time that we were given, but I feel we could have gotten a little more done with a more focused approach.
