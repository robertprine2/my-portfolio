				<h3>Module 1: Mastering the Browser</h3>

				<h4> Length: 5 weeks</h4>

				<button type="button" class="button-white" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#Module1"><p>Expand &DownArrowBar;</p></button>

				<div class="collapse" id="Module1">

					<p><b>Week 1:</b> In the first week, we were introduced to GIT/GitHub, taken through HTML, and learned the basics of CSS.</p>

					<p>The homework was to create a basic portfolio website that matched pictures given to us changing personal information to showcase ourselves (Grade: A).</p>

					<p><b>Week 2:</b> In the second week, we focused on CSS in depth, including bootstrap and how to make websites responsive. In addition, they taught us how to put our files onto Heroku's servers so that our web pages could be viewed by everyone on the internet. We covered a lot of different ways to manipulate a webpage and were encouraged to dig deeper on our own.</p>

					<p>The homework was to make our <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/Basic-Portfolio.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Robert's Basic Portfolio">basic portfolio website responsive</a> and to create a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/my-portfolio.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - This Website">unique portfolio website</a> (Grade: A), using bootstrap or coding on our own, that we could use to highlight our strengths and future projects to prospective employers.</p>

					<p><b>Week 3:</b> In the third week, we learned the basics of Javascript. We covered different variables including arrays and objects. We then used those variables to make functions and methods to produce basic games.</p>

					<p>The homework was to make a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/Hangman.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Brains: Dead Walking">themed hangman game</a> (Grade: A) using what we have learned so far in Javascript.

					<p><b>Week 4:</b> In the fourth week, we learned more about JavaScript, but focused on jQuery. We also covered some theory with scope and how to arrange variables in your code. There were a lot of games with button components as well as making a calculator in the browser complete with buttons.</p>

					<p>The homework was to make a game where characters would fight each other when you clicked an attack button. I learned two important lessons from this week's homework. Do not go too deep for a project you only have one week to work on and dynamic programming is much better than copying and pasting code and then having to go back and tweak the code for each different character. I wasn't able to finish <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/rpgGame" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Street Brawl: Legends Rising">my interpretation</a> of the game in time so I had to create the <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/week-4-game.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Star Wars RPG">regular homework</a> (Grade: A) on the last day.</p>

					<p><b>Week 5:</b> In the fifth week, we learned more about JavaScript and jQuery with a focus on "this" in coding and using time through setInterval and setTimeout. We also reviewed previous content, covered some interview dos and don'ts, and got a chance to meet with Sugarfree Media Group to help give us insight into our future careers.</p>

					<p>The homework was to make a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/TriviaGame.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Trivia Game">trivia game</a> (Grade: A).</p>

				<h3>Module 2: API and JSON</h3>

				<h4>Length: 4 weeks</h4>

				<button type="button" class="button-white" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#Module2"><p>Expand &DownArrowBar;</p></button>

				<div class="collapse" id="Module2">

					<p><b>Week 6:</b> In the sixth week, we learned APIs and how to access JSON data. We used several different APIs to practice making calls into the objects to put data on a web page. In addition, Rajiv Menon, the founder of Informulate, talked to us about having a plan going into the field through using Lean Startup and Agile methodologies, continuously learning because the tech world is constantly changing, and integrating yourself within a company through learning different aspects beyond just development. This will help to make you more productive, have more of a big picture feel of the goals of the company, and make you more of an asset to the company as a whole since you are tied to more than just one replaceable niche.</p>

					<p>The homework was to make a website that used the <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/giphy.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Giphy API">Giphy API</a> (Grade: A).</p>

					<p><b>Week 7:</b> In the seventh week, we learned about local storage, session storage, and cookies. We also covered Firebase to allow us access to servers to store and retrieve data to add persistence to websites and Moment.js to manipulate time.</p>

					<p>The homework was to make a website that allowed two people on different computers to duke it out in a fast paced game of <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/rps-plain.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - RPS">rock, paper, scissors</a> (Grade: A).</p>

					<p><b>Week 8-9:</b> In the eighth and ninth weeks, we worked in teams to create a web app. I was chosen to be the team lead and it gave me a different look into the world of coding.</p>

					<p>I thought this week was a very good experience overall since this is what coding in most workplaces would be like. As for imporvements, I learned that I should have been more clear with timelines on goals for my team members, we should have split the project up into smaller chunks so that you would get more of a sense of accomplishment when you completed a task (instead of just telling someone to do HTML/CSS, which doesn't give a smooth progression and the details aren't discussed), and that communication is extremely important, so it would have been more helpful to my team if I had done some type of expectations with communication from the beginning. I did learn a lot from my group members about branding, some APIs that I hadn't used before, and we did finish our goal for the basic app (we had much bigger plans for it, but we wouldn't have been able to complete everything within the time allotted). I also got to experience a lot more of Git/GitHub with branches, merging, conflicts, and reverting to old code (a lot), so I feel more well rounded with it now.</p>

					<p>The homework was to make a web app that was persistent, used at least two APIs, and had a lot of other minor requirements as well. Our team created an app called <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/EventSpot-" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Event Spot">Event Spot</a> (There was no grade for this group project) that allows users to plan all the different aspects of events, parties, gatherings, etc. in one spot. We used firebase to store users, who logged in through their google accounts, and the Foursquare, Google Maps, and eBay APIs to allow users to find venues, buy decorations, and buy outfits for their event. If we had more time we would have built in a catering section, added more options for decorations and outfits through other APIs, added a messaging function to discuss the progress of the event, create a total purchase amount to show what the total cost would be of all items currently listed in Event Spot, add a way to switch between multiple events so that you wouldn't only have one area to work on, and buttons to allow for sharing the event, when completed, to various social media websites.</p>

					<p>After we created our app, we had to pitch it to our classmates and share its functionality. This was another great experience since pitching ideas to buyers or my employer is going to be something I see myself doing in the future. Overall, I was pleased with what we accomplished in the time that we were given, but I feel we could have gotten a little more done with a more focused approach.

				<h3>Module 3: Server Side</h3>

				<h4>Length:6 weeks</h4>

				<button type="button" class="button-white" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#Module3"><p>Expand &DownArrowBar;</p></button>

				<div class="collapse" id="Module3">

					<p><b>Week 10:</b> In the tenth week, we learned about Node.js. We focused on calling APIs, reading and writing .txt files through the command line, and making constructors and classes. I was on vacation in Virginia this week, which made it a little more difficult to keep up due to the fact that I had to drive to a gas station to get Wi-Fi. Thankfully the concepts were fairly basic.</p>
					<p>The homework was to make a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/liri-node-app.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - LIRI">Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface (LIRI)</a> (Grade: A) which would use Git Bash to search Twitter, Spotify, and OMDb APIs. In addition, it needed to read a .txt file and make a command based on what was written in the .txt file.</p>

					<p><b>Week 11:</b> In the eleventh week, we had bad weather for one of the classes and reviewed content for the others. The homework from the previous week was given extra time to turn in due to the bad weather.</p>
					<p>I had a lot more down time this week and was able to focus on some aspects of my (this) portfolio website that I wanted to modify and started watching lectures from <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm" target="_blank" title="MIT: Introduction to Algorithms">MIT: Introduction to Algorithms.</a></p>
					<p>This week we had to complete an assessment to see what concepts needed to be reviewed in class and how well people were retaining new knowledge. (Grade: A)</p>

					<p><b>Week 12:</b> In the twelfth week, we started learning MySQL. We covered database creation; entering, updating, and deleting inputs; making queries to retrieve the data we inputed; using joins; and using the npm mysql package to call database information through Node.js.</p>

					<p>In addition, Warren Macchi, the President of Abamis IT, spoke with the class on Saturday. He told us about his company, answered questions, and gave an interesting look into the day of a developer through a time lapse video.</p>

					<p>The homework was to make a Node.js application that simulated a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/bamazon.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Storefront">storefront using MySQL</a> (Grade: A), which had three levels of difficulty to complete if time allowed: a customer view, a manager view, and an executive view.</p>

					<p><b>Week 13:</b> In the thirteenth week, we took a step back from MySQL and focused on using Express and routing information back and forth using a server.js file. We used routing files to be able to serve up HTML pages with CSS based on what was typed in the URL of the website. We were also able to use our data to dynamically create the HTML pages and get or post data to our websites "API."</p>

					<p>The data that we posted was not persistent because the information was only stored on our server while it stayed online. This could have been fixed if we used a MySQL database to store our information, but I'm assuming we will get to that in coming weeks.</p>

					<p>The homework was to make a Node.js application that was similar to a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/friendFinder.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Friend Finder">dating website</a> (Grade: ). This website would give the user a survey and then take the information from the results and compare the answers with other "users" (predetermined people since we weren't making the data persistent). After the comparison was complete it would provide you with the person from the database that was most similar to you based on how you answered the survey.</p>

					<p>Outside of the UCF Coding Boot Camp, I was offered an internship at Unikey Technologies and accepted. I started working there this Monday and am really enjoying it. My coworkers are all extremely friendly and the work environment one of the best I have ever encountered. However, this will be quite the undertaking since I have to learn C# and Visual Studio (these have not, and will not, be covered in the boot camp). C# doesn't seem too bad from what I have seen so far, but the MVC model that is being used in Visual Studio feels daunting. That being said, I will learn both and do so quickly! What I learn will be used to create a blog website through Visual Studio and C# so that I can get some practical practice (that is fun to say!). I am excited about this new challenge and hope I can use this experience to get something full time down the road.</p>

					<p><b>Week 14:</b> In the fourteenth week, we started using Handlebars.js to easily create dynamic websites and also focused on tying in MySQL databases so that our data could be persistent (I knew it was coming!).</p>

					<p>The homework was to modify a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/hotRestaurant.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Hot Restaurant">restaurant reservation website</a> (Grade: A) to use Handlebars.js. They chose an easier homework due to the holiday weekend. Happy Fourth of July! <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>

					<p>At my internship I continued to work on removing aspects of code that were redundant due to some improvements that my direct surpervisor had coded in. After I removed those I started testing and debugging to make sure I didn't break anything. It turned out that none of my tests passed, but I learned a lot this week (especially about breaking code <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>) and will fix it next week!</p>

					<p><b>Week 15:</b> In the fifteenth week, we reviewed Handlebars.js and everything else we have covered to date.</p>

					<p>There was no homework this week other than finding teammates for our group projects. Overall, it was a pretty disappointing week. I wish we had covered more new information.</p>

					<p>This week at Unikey I continued to work on testing and finding the mistakes with the code that I had modified. It turned out that one of the sections I had removed was necessary for the code base and needed to be added back. All it takes is one little mistake to gum up the works! I ran 63 other tests after the first ten and was getting good results on all of them but one, which my team lead said he wanted to look into since the test in question "could be a bit tricky at times."</p>

				<h3>Module 4: Group Projects</h3>
				<h4>Length: 2 weeks</h4>

				<button type="button" class="button-white" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#Module4"><p>Expand &DownArrowBar;</p></button>

				<div class="collapse" id="Module4">

					<p><b>Week 16:</b> In the sixteenth week, we worked with our groups on our projects. My group consisted of four other very talented students and we had a good idea to start with: we were going to make a <a href="https://github.com/mgusmano84/Herd.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Herd">car pool app</a>.</p>

					<p>Mary had the original idea to have a car pool app that would be used by parents to coordinate sports games and practices. This would be an organized way of keeping track of who was in charge of driving on particular days, geolocation to show where the carpool was for parents to have peace of mind (this got pushed into future developments), as well as several other features. I mistook what the goal was at first and, due to that, thought it would be cool to have an Uber-like app for carpooling to work with people that worked in the same general area/office. It could be a neat way to meet people, save money, and SAVE THE WORLD through less carbon emissions!</p>

					<p>For the first week I had a main focus of creating MySQL ORMs through the npm package as well as creating the database/table schema and dummy data to test the website with. However, I helped out in other areas where needed like creating the Trello board that we used to stay organized and split up tasks into bite sized chunks.</p>

					<p>While I was at Unikey, I was focused on learning C# since my team lead had given me a basic project of creating a calculator in ASP.NET using C#. My first attempt was a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/Calculator.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Basic Calculator">basic calculator</a> that could only work with 2 to 3 numbers at a time.</p>

					<p>Since I finished it so quickly, I was told to modify it so that it could take any number of operands while still using order of operations correctly. I finished my <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/CalculatorLongerEquations.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Longer Equation Calculator">longer equation calculator</a> the next day and did a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/winformCalculator.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Winform Calculator">winform calculator</a> for fun. This was my first experience using Regex, and I liked it a lot (<a href="http://regexstorm.net/tester" target="_blank" title="Regex Storm .NET - Tests your regex">Regex Storm .NET</a> was very helpful).</p>

					<p><b>Week 17:</b> In the seventeenth week, we continued work with our groups. We had a goal of trying to finish <a href="https://github.com/mgusmano84/Herd.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Herd">Herd</a> by Thursday so that we could focus on the presentation side of things before Saturday. Due to this, we had to cut back more items that we would have liked to include so that we could have a minimum viable product to present. It was hard to make cuts, but it gave us things to talk about for future development (a lot of things).</p>

					<p>At this point we had made tasks even more specific and were just listing tasks that needed to be done on the Trello board and people were moving them to their area if they chose to work on them. This method worked really well for us outside of some overlap when people would forget to move the task to their section, but I liked the approach over everyone taking large chunks of the project. There was less time spent waiting around because if you couldn't work on a specific portion yet, you just took another task.</p>

					<p>In the end, I thought our team did a great job. Everyone was pulling their weight and we ended up with a working product and a solid presentation. Edit: Our group got an award for our project - "Most Useful" (Grade: A)!</p>

					<p>At my internship, I was given my next downtime project of making a blog through ASP.NET MVC. I spent a lot of time watching YouTube and Lynda videos to try and get some basics down for the structure in Visual Studio while I waited for my next ticket. This was much harder than understanding C# (not that I have a thorough understanding of that yet, but there is a lot going on in a solution file) in my opinion. Toward the end of the week I was getting the basic framework of it though.</p>

				<h3>Module 5: MongoDB, React, PHP, and Final Projects</h3>

				<h4>Length: 6 weeks</h4>

				<button type="button" class="button-white" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#Module5"><p>Expand &DownArrowBar;</p></button>

				<div class="collapse" id="Module5">

					<p><b>Week 18:</b> In the eighteenth week, we started working with MongoDB and Cheerio. Cheerio is a Node.js package that allows you to scrape websites for information. During our practice activity I won a bet with our instructor that I could scrape the website using JavaScript over Cheerio's helpers (I still used Cheerio to store the website as a whole). I am now $1 richer!</p>

					<p>MongoDB is an alternative to MySQL using objects in "collections" to store information instead of tables with rows and columns. I feel that MongoDB allows for me freedom in how you store your information and, because of that, I think I enjoy it more, but it is still early to tell for sure.</p>

					<p>The homework for this week was to make a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/Scraper" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Scraper">website</a> (Grade: A) that scraped information from a blog and stored that information in MongoDB to allow others to look at the material from my website.</p>

					<p>At my internship, I was given my next ticket to standardize throw statements throughout the companies code. I was able to finish this in two days and submitted my pull request.</p>

					<p>While I was waiting for my code to be reviewed I worked on my blog some more and was able to create tables for users, posts, and comments in Visual Studio's version of MySQL. I had a great deal of trouble trying to figure out how data was being connected in some areas due to the large amount of "programming magic" that Visual Studio 2015 uses, but I was making progress.</p>

					<p><b>Week 19:</b> We spent the nineteenth week learning about React. I had a difficult time this week due to the amount of material and pace of what we covered. We had two different instructors than who we were used to since our normal teacher was out of town for business. That being said, the main fault lays on my shoulders since I was more focused on my blog at my internship, and I should have been practicing more React in my off time. Thankfully we will be reviewing React in the upcoming weeks.</p>

					<p>Meanwhile, at Unikey, I got some comments on my code about minor spacing problems, which lead to me getting a subscription to Resharper since they were automatic spacing from Visual Studio. Now I have access to the mythical ctrl+t (which is just a better ctrl+f) and a much easier way to clean up spacing and formatting of my code before submitting a pull request. After I modified my code to appease the comments I solved some merge conflicts and the ticket was completed *dusts off hands*!</p>

					<p>I also had my first one on one this week with my project lead. He told me that he was impressed with the amount of information I was learning and the speed that I was learning it considering I had no background in C# or Visual Studio and not much experience before that. He also said he was sorry he wasn't working with me as much as he would like to, but that is understandable considering his work load. Overall, I feel it went well and the bacon cheeseburger was delicious!</p>

					<p>The rest of the week I focused on my blog. I had a difficult time connecting multiple model data on one view page, but after hours upon hours of searching the internet and asking questions I figured it out. My blog is now a minimum viable product allowing users to login, create content, and make comments that are connected to individual posts. I even had some time to work on some front end to make the website look a little nicer (it is still pretty ugly).</p>

					<p><b>Week 20:</b> Week 20 was all about the basics of PHP. I found this week enjoyable, but very basic. We did talk about object oriented programming and constructors in PHP, but I wish we could have dove deeper into it or done some actual projects/homework using PHP. I guess they wanted us focused on our final project that is starting next week.</p>

					<p>Unikey was also fairly slow this week since I didn't get any tickets, but I did work on the blog some more doing a lot of front end. I also started working on confirmation emails on register to root out possible bots.</p>

					<p><b>Week 21:</b> Week 21 is the start of our final project! I have grandios plans that probably need to be taken back a bit due to time and the fact that I am not on a team, but I am excited.</p> 

					<p>I want to make an app that promotes exploring the world around you (mainly for kids) that will hopefully push children to go outside more. It would allow for the user to take pictures of interesting things they see (plants, animals, art, etc...), describe it, and use Google Maps to show where they found it. It would also allow others to help them figure out the name for the plant/animal/etc and give more information about it. I'm hoping it will be a good way to get kids excited about learning and keep them more physically fit.</p>
	<!--************I NEED TO ADD A LINK TO MY PLANNING INFO-->
					<p>The first week we are supposed to do a lot of <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/DiscoverItPlanning" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Discover It! - Planning">planning</a> and research to lay out what we hope to accomplish with our app.</p>

					<p>In addition to working on our final project, we also did a mock interview and learned Laravel framework for PHP. I really like how easy Laravel is to use!</p>
	<!--***********Need to finish this at the end of the week-->
					<p>At Unikey, I was given a project to make an easy way for people to store specific kinds of data about types of devices being used with the app. This would allow developers to get more precise information about possible future issues and what is causing them.</p>
