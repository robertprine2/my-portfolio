Now, you might be thinking, 'What makes this Robert Prine better than the hundreds upon hundreds of other Robert Prines out there?' Be prepared, your education is about to start!</p>
						
						<p>I am a fast learner and problem solver that is detail-oriented, creative, productive, and works well with others. These qualities are what make me a great fit with any organization. You may be thinking, 'How can this one person have all of these great qualities?' I know, it does seem impossible, but that is what makes me <em><b>the</b></em> Robert Prine.</p>

				<h3>Module 1: Mastering the Browser</h3>
				<h4> Length: 5 weeks</h4>
				<p><b>Week 1:</b> In the first week, we were introduced to GIT/GitHub, taken through HTML, and learned the basics of CSS. The homework was to create a basic portfolio website that matched pictures given to us (changing personal information to show who we were).</p>
				<p><b>Week 2:</b> In the second week, we focused on CSS in depth, including bootstrap and how to make websites responsive. In addition, they taught us how to put our files onto Heroku's servers so that our web pages could be viewed by everyone on the internet. We covered a lot of different ways to manipulate a webpage and were encouraged to dig deeper on our own. The homework was to make our <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/Basic-Portfolio.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Robert's Basic Portfolio">basic portfolio website responsive</a> and to create a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/my-portfolio.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - This Website">unique portfolio website</a>, using bootstrap or coding on our own, that we could use to highlight our strengths and future projects to prospective employers.</p>
				<p><b>Week 3:</b> In the third week, we learned the basics of Javascript. We covered different variables including arrays and objects. We then used those variables to make functions and methods to produce basic games. The homework was to make a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/Hangman.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Brains: Dead Walking">themed hangman game</a> using what we have learned so far in Javascript.
				<p><b>Week 4:</b> In the fourth week, we learned more about JavaScript, but focused on jQuery. We also covered some theory with scope and how to arrange variables in your code. There were a lot of games with button components as well as making a calculator in the browser complete with buttons. The homework was to make a game where characters would fight each other when you clicked an attack button. I learned two important lessons from this weeks homework. Do not go too deep for a project you only have one week to work on and dynamic programming is much better than copying and pasting code and then having to go back and tweak the code for each different character. I wasn't able to finish <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/rpgGame" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Street Brawl: Legends Rising">my interpretation</a> of the game in time so I had to create the <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/week-4-game.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Star Wars RPG">regular homework</a> on the last day.</p>
				<p><b>Week 5:</b> In the fifth week, we learned more about JavaScript and jQuery with a focus on "this" in coding and using time through setInterval and setTimeout. We also reviewed previous content, covered some interview dos and don'ts, and got a chance to meet with Sugarfree Media Group to help give us insight into our future careers. The homework was to make a <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/TriviaGame.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Trivia Game">trivia game</a>.</p>

				<h3>Module 2: API and JSON</h3>
				<h4>Length: 4 weeks</h4>
				<p><b>Week 6:</b> In the sixth week, we learned APIs and how to access JSON data. We used several different APIs to practice making calls into the objects to put data on a web page. Rajiv Menon, the founder of Informulate, talked to us about having a plan going into the field through using Lean Startup and Agile methodologies, continuously learning because the tech world is constantly changing, and integrating yourself within a company through learning different aspects beyond just development. This will help to make you more productive you have more of a big picture feel of the goals of the company, as well as making you more of an asset to the company as a whole since you are tied to more than just one replaceable niche. The homework was to make a website that used the <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/giphy.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - Giphy API">Giphy API</a>.</p>
				<p><b>Week 7:</b> In the seventh week, we learned about local storage, session storage, and cookies. We also covered Firebase to allow us access to servers to store and retrieve data and Moment.js to manipulate time. The homework was to make a website that allowed two people on different computers to duke it out in a fast paced game of <a href="https://github.com/robertprine2/rps-plain.git" target="_blank" title="GitHub - RPS">rock, paper, scissors</a>.</p>
